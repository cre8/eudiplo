# EUDIPLO

**EUDIPLO** is a middleware that simplifies integration with the **EUDI Wallet** ecosystem. It provides a modular and standards-compliant backend for issuing, verifying, and managing verifiable credentials without needing to implement complex protocols directly.

Use EUDIPLO as a self-contained Docker container in your infrastructure to handle all EUDI-related operations securely and efficiently.
