# Architecture Overview

**EUDIPLO** is a lightweight middleware designed to bridge the gap between
existing systems and the emerging ecosystem of **EUDI Wallets**. Instead of
implementing complex protocols such as OpenID4VP, SD-JWT, or DIDComm themselves,
developers can run EUDIPLO as a standalone Docker container and interact with it
via simple APIs or configuration files.

It acts as an **adapter** between trusted infrastructure and local applications
or web services.

---

## Purpose

The EUDI Wallet ecosystem introduces new technical standards and trust models
that are non-trivial to implement correctly. EUDIPLO handles these standards for
you, allowing existing systems to:

- **Issue** verifiable credentials
- **Verify** presentations
- **Manage** cryptographic keys securely
- **Persist** session data
- **Run in a self-contained Docker deployment**

## Main Components

| Module           | Responsibility                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `KeyModule`      | Manages signing keys (filesystem or Vault)                    |
| `DatabaseModule` | Stores session information using SQLite or PostgreSQL         |
| `CryptoModule`   | Provides local encryption utilities for sensitive data        |
| `IssuerModule`   | Loads and applies credential issuance configurations          |
| `VerifierModule` | Handles verification of incoming presentations                |
| `API Module`     | Exposes HTTP endpoints for credential flows and health checks |

---

## Typical Flow

Hereâ€™s a simplified data flow for a verification interaction:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Wallet
  participant EUDIPLO
  participant Verifier System
  participant Vault/DB

  Wallet->>+EUDIPLO: Sends presentation
  EUDIPLO->>Verifier System: Validates request intent
  EUDIPLO->>Vault/DB: Verifies signature, stores session
  EUDIPLO-->>Wallet: Returns verification result
```

Similarly, for issuance, EUDIPLO prepares credential data and signs it with a
trusted key.

---

## Deployment

EUDIPLO is shipped as a Docker image. It can be run with minimal setup via a
`.env` file. You can mount:

- a `config/` directory for SQLite data or credential configuration
- optional integration with Vault for key storage

EUDIPLO can be deployed as:

- a **standalone local service** (e.g., during development)
- a **backend service** in production (e.g., behind a gateway)

---

## Integration Patterns

You can use EUDIPLO as:

- An **internal credential issuance service** for your citizen portal, education
  platform, or company registry
- A **verifier bridge** to validate wallets without deeply integrating OpenID4VP
  etc.
- A **testing sandbox** for experimenting with EUDI protocols

---

## Extensibility

EUDIPLO is modular and extensible:

- Add new key management backends (e.g., AWS KMS)
- Customize issuance templates
- Extend the API layer with business-specific endpoints
